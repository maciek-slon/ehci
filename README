Enhanced Human Computer Interface library version 0.5
-----------------------------------------------------


Enhanced Human Computer Interface (EHCI) is a C++ webcam image processing library on top of OpenCV intended to generate events from user's head, hand and body movements. This library is also intended to track objects so that augmented reality can be made. In order to enhance human computer interaction, the application is going to use a single webcam, without the needs to use FTIR or Diffused Illumination techniques. Besides tracking positions, this library will also be able to provide higher level events and gestures like get 3d user position, and open hand gestures. Collision with virtual objects is also considered in augmented reality.

The development of this library was sponsored by Google (R) in 2008 Google Summer of Code.
